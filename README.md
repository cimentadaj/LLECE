## LLECE
An automatized merging of the Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education (LLECE) datasets. This repository contains scripts that download and merge the PERCE, SERCE and TERCE datasets. Until this point, PERCE and TERCE are finished and PERCE is at about 50%. 

These scripts rely heavily on RAR 5.2.1 for Mac OS X. The user should follow [these](http://best-mac-tips.com/2013/02/01/install-free-command-line-unrar-mac/) steps to download RAR 5.2.1 for command line. It is sufficient to simply install the program and the scripts will do everything else. The scripts have been tested only in Mac OSx El Capitan but I plan to test them on Windows eventually.
